bookconnect
===========

A startup idea for dealing with sharing, buying and renting of books (and other material) through this website.
Though the startup never took off, the backend of the website was ready. It has a proper logging in system, a method to add your books to the database, and a system to query them. 
Another feature is that a person can query for the book and send a request to the owner, and the owner can either accept or reject the request.
The searching part which includes a way to search for books in the database is very primitive, and I was planning to use an open source search engine like Sphinx.
This repo contains only the backend of the website and the limited amount of HTML used is only for debugging purposes.

If you plan to work on it further, please read the TODO.txt file for new ideas, bugs etc.

PS. The code is pretty modular and divided into files, if you want to use certain sections, it'll be quite easy to do so! :)

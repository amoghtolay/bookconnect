<h1>
Bookconnect v2.0<br> This is a more modular code than bookconnect1 and a new section is added!!
</h1>
<h2>A more modular code, more no. of small files rather than huge files<br></h2>
<p>
All known bugs and improvements suggested by u guys have been implemented...<br>
<br><b>There is a new section in the site, the last link on member-index page,
which allows you to list stuff/service that you want to share/sell  like ED Sets, Cycles, ASKING FOR CARPOOL etc etc!!<br>
As of now, this section is very basic and admins will have to approve requests before it is displayed on the site, and also the username of the owner is directly
shown, no requests, but certainly this can be made just like the book transaction method without much hassle!!<br><br></b>
There are just three tables, <br>one called members which deals with login and authentication<br>
Second table called books stores info abt books and their owners!!<br>
The third table called requests stores values about requests to buy and their status<br><br>

Status Report of the Website bookconnectv2.0!!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TO DO TODAY!!!!!

1.	Make a section of the site for carpooling!! It should be plain and simple with a complete 'searchable(based on day and location)' list!! It should display
	everything as someone might go for a compromise...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unrectified Bugs:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Things to Do:
1. 	Write Forgot Paswd File

1.	Help in making frontend of the site!!

2.	Make a forum for each course where students can discuss abt profs/courses etc. etc. :P

3.	Make a section where videos can be shared, like IITG TV!! Idea from that TED Talks, probably share ur expts/ted vids etc

4.	Make a section of the site for carpooling!! It should be plain and simple with a complete 'searchable(based on day and location)' list!! It should display
	everything, not just search results, as someone might go for a compromise...

5.  Make a portion of site in which people can just list all their sale/purchase/carpool/Old Cars/Bikes/Tours N Travels/Personal Finance etc....
	and this will be displayed in the table in the form of a table that everyone can see...
	The thing is that it will be published after acceptance from one of the site administrators
	This site portion is named liststuff.php as of now

6.	Make a facebook kind of section on the site, where everyone is everyones friend(like a small community :P), and then make small groups, which
	appear differently for each user, for eg. i might add say a senior like rajat bhaiya in this group, but other seniors whom i dont know might still group me
	into one of their groups. 
	Basically it is absoulutely identical to the concept of "Lists" In facebook!!
	Using check-boxes, select a list of people/groups and then send them a common message at once
	
7.	Make Drop-Down menu for addbook and searchbook

8.	Make code more and more modular, easy to manage and modify

9.	Make code hack/crack proof, especially where GET Request is used

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Things to be modified in the final site on webserver:

1.	Regarding activation mail:
		a) register-exec redirects to activate.php (commented presently)-DONE
		b) activation.php is the exec version of activate.php which checks if code is valid and then updates status to active-DONE
		c) login-exec is changed to ensure that status=active-DONE
		d) activate.php generates the unique url and sends a mail-DONE
			
		Activation is working fine, the only thing to change is update activate.php file so that it generates full URL and sends it to the mail address
		
2.	Make a GUI based entry for admins so that they can accept/deny requests for approving 'stuff'
